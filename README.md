# Gravity - Assessment

Problem:

Given an array of integers, return the length of the longest increasing subsequence. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, given the array [10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18], the longest increasing subsequence is [2, 3, 7, 101], and its length is 4.

## Solution

Implemented the solution in `app.js` in root folder.

## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/git1113/gravity-assignment.git
```

Go to the gravity-assignment directory

```bash
  cd gravity-assignment
```

Execute the app.js file

```bash
  node app.js
```

We can see the output in console.
