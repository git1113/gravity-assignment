# Solution for problem 

Given an array of integers, return the length of the longest increasing subsequence. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, given the array [10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18], the longest increasing subsequence is [2, 3, 7, 101], and its length is 4.
